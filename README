INSTALLATION:
Source ck.sh in your ~/.bashrc.  It will create a ~/.ck directory, and it uses this directory to manage tag locations.
If you would like to store your tags somewhere else, set CKDIR to that location before sourcing ck.sh.

USAGE:
'ck'                - sets the default tag to current directory
'ck $tag'           - sets named tag to current directory
'gock'              - changes directory to where the default tag points to
'gock $tag'         - changes directory to where the named tag points to
'ckck'              - lists all tags
'ckck $partial_tag' - lists all tags that look like $partial_tag
'delck $tag'        - deletes a named tag.  Does wildcard expansion, so be careful about deleting too many tags
'..to $some_dir'    - Changes directory to the first parent directory named '$some_dir'
